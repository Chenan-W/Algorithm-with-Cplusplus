# Bit manipulation

## Corresponding Problems on LeetCode
* Bit Operations
  * Check the kth bit of `x` is `1` or `0`: `x & (1 << k)`
  * Set the kth bit of `x` to `1`: `x | (1 << k)`
  * Set the kth bit of `x` to `0`: `x | ~(1 << k)`
  * Invert the kth bit of `x`: `x ^ (1 << k)`
  * Set the last `1` bit of `x` to `0`: `x & (x - 1)`, e.g `1101` to `1100`
  * Set all the `1` bits to `0`, except for the last `1` bit: `x & -x`, e.g `1101` to `0001`
  * Invert all the bits after the last `1` bit: `x | (x âˆ’ 1)`, e.g `10100` to `10111`
  * Check a positive number `x` is a power of two: `x & (x - 1) == 0`
