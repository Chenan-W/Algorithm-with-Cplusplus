# Tree Queries
* what is the kth ancestor of a node?
* what is the sum of values in the subtree of a node?
* what is the sum of values on a path between two nodes?
* what is the lowest common ancestor of two nodes?

## Subtrees and Paths
A **tree traversal array(a kind of preorder traversal)** contains the nodes of a rooted tree in the order in which a depth-first search from the root node visits them. We also need a corresponding array that contains the **subtree size** of each node.

## Lowest Common Ancestor
The lowest common ancestor of two nodes of a rooted tree is the lowest node whose subtree contains both the nodes.
