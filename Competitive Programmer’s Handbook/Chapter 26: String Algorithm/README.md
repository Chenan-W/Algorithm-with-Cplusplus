# String Algorithm

## String Terminology
We assume that zero-based indexing is used in strings. Strings are compared using the **lexicographical order**.   
* **Substring**: a sequence of consecutive characters in a string.
* **Subsequence**: is a sequence of (not necessarily consecutive) characters in a string in their original order.
* **Prefix(Suffix)**: a substring that starts at the beginning(ends at the end) of a string.
* **Rotation**: can be generated by moving the characters of a string one by one from the beginning to the end (or vice versa).
* **Period**: a prefix of a string such that the string can be constructed by repeating the period.
* **Border**: a string that is both a prefix and a suffix of a string.
